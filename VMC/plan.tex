\section{Implementing the pieces}

In order to implement a variational Monte Carlo (VMC) program, we need:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\Psi(\bR,\bP)$, $\nabla \Psi(\bR,\bP)$, and $\nabla^2 \Psi(\bR,\bP)$
	\item A way to compute $\frac{H\Psi(\bR,\bP)}{\Psi(\bR,\bP)}$
	\item A function to generate samples with probability proportional to $|\Psi|^2$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Wave function object}

\subsubsection{Testing}

Numerical versus analytic gradients.

\subsection{Hamiltonian object}



\subsubsection{Testing}

Known potential configurations.

\subsection{Metropolis algorithm}

\subsubsection{Testing}

Exact wave function averages. Kinetic energy and potential energy.

\section{Optimizing one parameter}

At this point we have a system that can evaluate properties of a wave function. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Where is the minimum if we don't include electron-electron interaction? Notice anything about the errors at that point?
\item What happens to the minimum when interactions are included? Errors?
\item What is the behavior of the kinetic and potential energies as a function of $\alpha$? Do they make sense?	
\end{itemize}


\section{Add a Jastrow factor: optimizing two parameters} 

Compare the $\exp(0.5r_{12})$ factor to no Jastrow. We will not optimize them in detail because there are better techniques.

\section{Computing expectation values}

\begin{itemize}
\item Radial distribution function	
\end{itemize}

\section{The linear method for optimization} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Expectation values we need
\item Testing 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Programming parameter derivatives}
